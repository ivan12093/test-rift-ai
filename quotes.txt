Patience is the art of hoping.
Knowledge without wisdom is like water in sand.
Wisdom begins with wonder.
Listen carefully, speak wisely, act decisively.
Time is the most valuable resource we have.
Calmness is not the absence of storms, but the ability to dance in the rain.
Wisdom comes through experience, experience through mistakes.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
